Problem
Design 2 apps with the below requirements

App 1

There is one Activity with a Edittext and a Button
The user will enter his name in the Edittext and On click of send button the user must be able to share this name using his App2.
Use android.content.Intent.ACTION_SEND as intent Action.
App2

The Second app has 2 Activities
The First Activity will display Hello World in a TextView.
There is one More Activity called ReceiveActivity which has a text view that will display the name sent from App1.
Note

Use proper Intent Filter in App2 to receive the message sent from App1
